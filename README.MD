## Summary

The SVG is a customizable "fruit warrior." So default fruit is the avocado one, but the colors could be changed and be made into a different fruit with a similar structure. 

The paths are separated into the body, the outer and inner shell, and seed. Minor ones such as eye, blush and smile are there for aesthetic purposes.
